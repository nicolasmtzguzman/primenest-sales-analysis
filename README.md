# PrimeNest Sales Analysis
## Project Background
PrimeNest, a US-based e-commerce company specializes in selling popular technology, furniture, and office supplies products. I'm constructing a report for the Director of Analytics that examines sales records across 2020-2023 and extracts insights to deliver recommendations that will improve performance across sales, product, and marketing teams.
## Executive Summary
PrimeNest’s sales analysis of records across 2020-2023 shows annual sales averaging around $574,000 with peak performance in the final months of the year. The number of orders has increased 74% in the timeframe with phone products being the leading category. Copiers, like the Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier lead all products in sales and accounted for 26% of all profit last year despite a low order count. PrimeNest has an incredibly loyal customer base, but would benefit from additional marketing to attract new customers and drive sustainable growth.

## Recommendations
**1. Minimize Product Offerings**
- With over 1,800 products offered, none represent over 2% of all sales.
- Decrease catalog variation in categories like phones, paper, and storage to reduce customer confusion and eliminate ‘choice paralysis’.
- Improve focus on the core products that account for the most sales and profit, like the Samsung Galaxy Mega or Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier.


**2. Strengthen Market Presence**
- Since less than 2% of customers last year were new, marketing efforts must be addressed and prioritized.
- Consider adding more marketing channels with new promotions to attract more customers.


**3. Regional Growth Strategies**
- Continue focusing on high-performing states like California, New York, and Washington with regionalized marketing tailored to local preferences.
- Introduce new tailored promotions to states that have growth potential like Texas, Pennsylvania, and Florida to stabilize sales in those emerging markets.


**4. Introduce Loyalty Program**
- Although customer retention and repeat purchase rates are some of PrimeNest’s best metrics, a loyalty program could further solidify the acquisition of new customers.
- Enhance loyalty onboarding by implementing campaigns with first-purchase discounts and early access offers.
